           A high level API for Python internationalization.
           
           The ``flufl.i18n`` library provides a convenient API for managing translation
           contexts in Python applications.  It provides facilities not only for
           single-context applications like command line scripts, but also more
           sophisticated management of multiple-context applications such as Internet
           servers.

           1.1.1 (2012-04-19)
           ==================
            * Add classifiers to setup.py and make the long description more compatible
              with the Cheeseshop.
            * Other changes to make the Cheeseshop page look nicer.  (LP: #680136)
            * setup_helper.py version 2.1.
           
           
           1.1 (2012-01-19)
           ================
            * Support Python 3 without the need for 2to3.
           
           
           1.0.4 (2010-12-06)
           ==================
            * Restore missing line from MANIFEST.in to fix distribution tarball.
           
           
           1.0.3 (2010-12-01)
           ==================
            * Fix setup.py to not install myfixers artifact directory on install.
            * Remove pylint.rc; we'll use pyflakes instead.
           
           
           1.0.2 (2010-06-23)
           ==================
            * Small documentation fix.
           
           
           1.0.1 (2010-06-09)
           ==================
            * Ditch the use of zc.buildout.
            * Improved documentation.
           
           
           1.0 (2010-04-24)
           ================
            * Use Distribute instead of Setuptools.
            * Port to Python 3 when used with 2to3.
            * More documentation improvements.
           
           
           0.6 (2010-04-21)
           ================
            * Documentation and lint clean up.
           
           
           0.5 (2010-04-20)
           ================
            * Added a simplified initialization API for one-language-context
              applications. This works much better for non-server applications.
            * Added a SimpleStrategy which recognizes the $LOCPATH environment variable.
            * Show how PEP 292 strings are supported automatically.
            * When strategies are called with zero arguments, they supply the default
              translation context, which is usually a NullTranslation.  This is better
              than hardcoding the NullTranslation in the Application.
           
           
           0.4 (2010-03-04)
           ================
            * Add the ability to get the current language code, via _.code
           
           
           0.3 (2009-11-15)
           ================
            * Initial release; refactored from Mailman 3.
